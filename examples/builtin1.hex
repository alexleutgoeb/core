% we want this functionality: (X,Y) < (b,c)

% encoded comfortably as this
b1(X,Y) :- foo(X), bar(Y), <(mmm(X,Y),mmm(b,c)).

% encoded verbatim as this (for example)
b2(X,Y) :- foo(X), bar(Y), X < b.
b2(X,Y) :- foo(X), bar(Y), X == b, Y < c.

difference(X,Y) :- b1(X,Y), not b2(X,Y).
difference(X,Y) :- b2(X,Y), not b1(X,Y).
